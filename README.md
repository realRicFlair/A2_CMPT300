Simple-Talk for cmpt300

Possible Errors:
I didnt have a partner to exactly test the project on different CSIL computers. To my knowledge you cant log into multiple CSIL instances.
However, it does seem to work on my local computer, and on one singular CSIL instance. I hope the IP addresses get resolved as it should, but im not entirely sure.

Also, memmory leaks might be an issue since my pthread exit mechanism wasnt the most graceful or clean.
However, after some testing, there seems to be no memmory leaks so far.
